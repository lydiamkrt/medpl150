<p>I mainly use photography as a mode of preserving memories. Whether it be for utilitarian purposes, like taking a picture of an important document in case I lose it, or for personal enjoyment, my camera roll is an extension of my memory. The unfortunate combination of being terribly nostalgic/sentimental while having ADHD related memory issues has led to an overcompensation on my part by photographing /anything/ that stands out to me as even a tiny bit worthy of remembering, for fear of regretting it later.</p>
